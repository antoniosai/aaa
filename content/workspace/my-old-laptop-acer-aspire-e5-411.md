6 years of journey from 2014 ~ 2020 with my old but lovely laptop. But hardly to say, "This time you should rest buddy, thanks for helping me to do a lot of works and earn money".

I bought my laptop in Nov, 2014 to replace my PC with AMD Bulldozer FX8350 to gain my mobility. The Price is about 7million IDR or about 593 USD at that time, that was pricey enough for me because i don't have a job at that time (got money from my parents and save it)

Spesification is :

<ul>
  <li>Processor : Core i5 4210u Hashwell (1.8GHz, 2 cores & 4 threads)</li>
  <li>Memory : 1x4Gigs PC-12800 DDR3L SODIMM (Upgraded to 2x8Gigs)</li>
  <li>HDD : 2.5" SATA III 500GB with 5400RPM</li>
  <li>ODD : (Replaced with SSD 2.5" 512GB with 2.5" Bracket to attach storage into it, not a famous brand and i forgot)</li>
  <li>Discrette Graphic : NVDIA GT820M</li>
  <li>Integrated Graphic : Intel HD 4400</li>
  <li>Display : HD Display with 1366x768 px of resolution</li>
</ul>

In 2014, i used my laptop to learn Programming, do an assignment, task from my campus and playing DoTA at night time. I have no complains at this period because everything runs with no doubt, feel like i've choose a right laptop for me hehehe.

My First Application Project in 2015. Finally, after i learn how to build an Application and my friend know that i was able to do their project so i tried to help them with my basic knowledge of Programming. After finished, i earn some money and feel so happy. With that money i earn then i upgraded my RAM & SSD. After a happy moment, I decided to find another projects to earn some money with my laptop and this lasts until 2019 i work as a Freelancer.

In Nov, 2019. I started my First Journey to Work in Company Professionally at GMF AeroAsia as Outsource Employee. My responsibility is to build an Application using PHP with Laravel Framework, my laptop runs well and i don't have a complain about it.

Pandemic Era in 2020 that forces me to work from home. And I have new responsibility to build Mobile Application, my laptop doesn't handle it anymore. As you know, developing mobile application needs more resources and good specification because I need to run mobile emulator, run a local API server, do some test and everything at once should run on my laptop. So i decided to stop using my laptop after 6 years usage, if i force to use my laptop i think i'll still able to do my work but not fast enough and nowadays application is heaver and heavier.
