title: My Ryzen Computer
---

Current Computer Status : <i>In Good-Health. Currently used by my Family at Home, cause I work at difference city (On-Site)</i>

Built in Pandemic's Era that forces me to Work From Home (Oct, 2020). So i decided to build a powerful workstation to replace [My Old Laptop](/notes/social-menu)

I use AMD as my platform because of i have many pleasant & happy experience with AMD since i was a child. Started from <i>AMD Athlon XP 2100+ (at 2001-2010), AMD Phenom II X4 965 (2010-2013), AMD Bulldozer FX-8350 (2013, 2015)<i> and finally i replace my computer to a brand new Laptop ( [My Old Laptop Acer Aspire E450-11](/notes/social-menu)) due to i need high mobility that able to do my study, my side job (at that time)

With that happy experience i just want to build my new Computer with AMD again.. Here is my List

<ul>
  <li>Processor : <strong>AMD Ryzen 5 3400G</strong> with (3.20 GHz, 4 cores and 8 thread)</li>
  <li>Motherboard : <strong>MSI A320M Pro2</strong></li>
  <li>Memory : <strong>V-Gen Tsunami DDR4 3200MHz 8x2 Gigs</strong> (CL16-16-19-21)</li>
  <li>Power Supply : <strong>Corsair CV550</strong></li>
  <li>1st Storage : <strong>V-Gen HyperV NVME 256GB</strong>. For Operating System</li>
  <li>2nd Storage : <strong>SSD 2.5" 128GB</strong> (Not a famous brand and i forget. Got it from my old laptop). I put my source codes/projects in this storage</li>
  <li>Displays : <strong>2x LG MK-220</strong> with TN Panel, 75Hz frame rate, Full-HD Resolution</li>
</ul>

I chose Ryzen 5 3400G because that's only what i need to do my job, i rarely play video games but when I do i only play DoTA 2 (no need special hardwares need, Vega 11 is good enough to run at Medium Quality Preset at Full HD Resolution).

2x8Gigs of RAM is reduced 2Gigs by a integrated GPU Vega 11, so the total usable memory is 14GB. That's good enough for me

I have no idea why i choose Corsair CV550

Dual Display LG-MK220. Well, The specification is a standard. It uses only TN Panel, not IPS Panel. Not a borderless.. But that's good enough for me, i dont really care about color gammut gives by a monitor cause my job doesn't need that detail of color. Also an IPS panel, honestly.. I can't see the differences between IPS and TN panel. Both of them are good, and the matter is The display has minimal Full HD Resolution and as long they show me a proper display output that i can see. That's good enough for me.

Here's my impression for my PC :

<ul>
  <li>Runs really fast, thanks to NVME SSD. Because i never used it before</li>
  <li>Dual displays make me to do a better job and boost my productivity</li>
  <li>I can develop Mobile Application much faster than My old Laptop</li>
<ul>
